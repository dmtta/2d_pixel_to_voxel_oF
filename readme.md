Pixel to Voxel oF sketch
------------------------

#### The following sketch is a simple image reader that translates loaded images into 3d voxels (ofDrawBox), right now it's only a translator from a 2d image to a 3d representation of the same one, it's building up to become a sculpture creator based on any imported image but right now I'm uploading it as is just in case I destroy my code in the process and need to back down.


##### kudos to @gianordoli and @whoisbma who are coaching in the background
